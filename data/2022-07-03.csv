In todays declining market economy we will see this need even more. We saw other countries influence the financial market as they struggled. The whole world is interconnected financially already and was looking for a bridge. Cryptocurrency can eliminate a variety of fees, authorization/transactions, and customer service fees that have burdened small businesses using the credit card system.  Cryptocurrency also facilitates cross-border transactions and save immigrants hundreds of billions bank fees in an attempt to send money to relatives living in developing countries. Those fees, known as remittances were 7.37% of the amount sent. Which is crazy in a globally interconnected world. Bitcoin payment system charges only 0.005 bitcoin or 1% of the transaction, Litecoin is mere pennies and both offer proof or work. This is an unarguable algorithm check that the funds were transferred peer to peer."
