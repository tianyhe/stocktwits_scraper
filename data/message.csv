Then you had &quot;companies&quot; with just a mediocre www address that got millions in funding. Remember localbands.com? Well I saw where those millions went as I attended parties after parties with free drinks etc... I saw no effort made to even have any road to profits. It was just print stocks and get money from that. That&#39;s it.  There is no good quality companies and business models out there to justify the secondary market (i.e securities post IPO) generating so much $$$ and so much bonuses for $GS and the hedgies unless bubbles are created.

Each time, just as the MA100 (blue) crossed the MA200 (red), the bitcoin price action just broke above the MA10 (green). Well...we just went above the 3 day MA10 and the MA100 crossing the MA200 now. To me it looks like we are at the bottom and will go somewhat sideways for the next 2-4 months or so until the MA10 (green) crosses the MA50 (yellow) then its off to the races.

Not sayin I’d be surprised, nor would it be impossible especially due to the world’s current economy, but those are going to be tough prices to reach based on the current adoption curve. Every drop is a new bargain and a discount for a new buyer and an existing holder.   Altcoins may dump much larger, since $eth.x seems to have become more of a sentiment for altcoin price indication than bitcoin now. And since ETH is moving over to POS, ASIC miners have more incentives to dump at higher liquidity.  However, ASICs are like only 40% of the miners. GPU miners making up for the 60%. ASIC miners most likely dumped what they wanted by now anyway. And since ETH was mined first n now moving to PoS, that gives it the commodity + security debate. Kinda bullish.

Andrew Left, founder of Citron Research says the idea of decentralization, where power is shifted from the hands of centralized entities is the “stupidest thing ever” and pointed out that the only utility Bitcoin has is that it is a collective consciousness of people, with people buying because others are.  https://www.yahoo.com/finance/news/exclusive-short-seller-andrew-left-204643042.html"

Microsoft began publicly trading on the stock exchange around 1985 and I think there are similarities to the creation of $ETH.X Ethereum and $QNT.X Quant around 2015. It took 15 years from the start of the computer and the internet to become a bubble in early 2000 that subsequently collapsed and I think we&#39;ll be in a Crypto bubble between 2030-2032 when the total crypto market cap reaches the area of 30 trillion dollars before collapsing. There will probably be a lull in early to mid 2030&#39;s before the market ramps back up again in late 2030&#39;s. I think we will hit a total crypto market cap of 300 trillion at some point in early 2050&#39;s.

Meanwhile, popular names like Cardano (ADA-USD), Solana (SOL-USD) and Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) have all fallen at least 60% so far in 2022.

This is usually followed by a relief rally then a bigger drop. We are now getting that relief rally looks like.  I am cautiously still watching. I have a nice starter position in btc and eth. If we drop more, I will add more. Once I know for sure we are at bottom, will go in heavier. Remember this, if everyone is expecting 10k, it will not happen and you will keep waiting and miss the bottom. Market always does opposite of the masses. We MAY be at bottom now.

Well it played out as expected. We failed to bounce off the top trendline of the triangle and we are back in it. That is also bearish. The Pi Cycle bottom indicator is also about to cross (green line crossing the red line). This cross so far in the past has marked the bottom of the bear market. Boys and girls, I think we are either AT bottom or about to capitulate in the next 24 to 48 hrs. Bottom may just mean we are going to revisit the prior lows from June 18 or could be lower. I am not trying to time the exact bottom so I am already averaging in myself. Not telling anyone else what to do. This is just my plan. I am backing up the truck and opening the rear gate and gonna sleep in the truck. I hope capitulation occurs during market hours cause my Roth IRA is also ready to load up more. OR all this could just be a load of crap and we go to moon tomorrow."

The former head of one exchange, under condition of anonymity, confirmed that Japanese crypto exchanges had encountered a recent intensification of pressure to relocate any mining or back-office operations out of Russia.

People say they&#39;ll wait for the bottom but is there a single on of them that knows what bottom is? Nope. So we have basically wiped out that massive bull run cycle and are entering back into pre run highs.    The only thing you really have to ask yourself right now is will $BTC.X $ETH.X ever see this current price level in the future again?  If the answer is yes, commit to it, enter, build down, do not sell anything lower then that first entry that you made.  Highly likely bitcoin and ethereum sees today&#39;s price again even if it loses massive value going forward in this bear cycle.  I don&#39;t feel this strategy would apply to these tickers that have no current or future utilization. Meaning, I wouldn&#39;t do this with a pure speculation crypto.

Before the first of the staked ETH can be sold another upgrade is required (Shanghai upgrade). Estimated at 6 months post-merge, but more likely 9-12 months. Only then will a queue begin for anyone that wants to sell (they&#39;ll be earning 12-15% so most probably won&#39;t want to sell). At present the queue would take well over 400 days to get through - and growing daily.     No staked ETH will be sold for Merge + 6 months minimum. and on average it&#39;ll be Merge + 12-20 months.

What the majority wants won’t matter.

Most people have zero understanding of the actual applications outside of utilizing it simply as a quasi-gambling financial asset on which to speculate. This is, in my opinion, the driving factor behind the extremely high volatility and massive swings in the cryptocurrencies connected to blockchain technology. It’s not viewed as a serious asset mostly because it is highly misunderstood — more so than probably any other technology. Blockchain will be similar to Social Media in the future in which almost every individual &amp; industry will utilize the technology in almost every aspect of life. Few cryptocurrencies will actually survive, and only the ones with actual legitimate real-word applications will exist or be taken seriously… much like social media where only a select few are used, however these platforms affect every aspect of our lives."

The whole world is interconnected financially already and was looking for a bridge. Cryptocurrency can eliminate a variety of fees, authorization/transactions, and customer service fees that have burdened small businesses using the credit card system.  Cryptocurrency also facilitates cross-border transactions and save immigrants hundreds of billions bank fees in an attempt to send money to relatives living in developing countries. Those fees, known as remittances were 7.37% of the amount sent. Which is crazy in a globally interconnected world. Bitcoin payment system charges only 0.005 bitcoin or 1% of the transaction, Litecoin is mere pennies and both offer proof or work.

It&#39;s like driving a model-t when there is a Ferrari out there. Yes Bitcoin was the first but it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the best in 2022+.  2) One of the main appeals of Bitcoin and was that you could send it anonymously-- well, the U.S government is putting a stop to that in general.  3) Banks are modernizing rapidly; when Bitcoin was first introduced, yes it was much faster but banks are now developing and already offering instantaneous money transfers (ie Zelle). So the role crypto could have played is being developed by banks through other means.  There is a place for crypto, especially in regards to ownership of digital art, like $ETH.X"

One thing that I’m noticing right now is that unanimously everyone of them is bearish towards Bitcoin and crypto for the short term. “The pain isn’t over” you hear them say, or “the crash is coming, bearish winter is here” Now I’m not going to say that they’re wrong that might be the case, but I can’t help but wonder how come most of them were ultra bullish since last year telling everyone that alt season is coming and to keep buying, hodl, laser eyes and diamond hands when crypto market was at the peak? Now they shifted to bearish and “be careful out there” when the market is 80/90% down🤔  Seems very odd to say the least."

Worse than dumping, he&#39;s trying to lure more victims in a desperate plea to save himself (or that&#39;s how his behavior looks to me).  Seriously -- this is why we all have to use our own heads and make our own decisions in the end. I admit, I&#39;ve been excited about a stock only to change my mind: new information = new decision, so it&#39;s possible he&#39;s an idiot who really believes $BTC is a good investment? 🤔  Why am I bearish? As banks modernize and embrace instantaneous transaction methods (ie  Zelle), the financial role of Crypto is diminished in importance. There are other roles, like ownership of digital art ($ETH.X and NFTs),   but crypto as a means of &#39;instantaneous financial transactions&#39; is losing its importance as banks modernize and as the US clamps down on anonymous crypto transactions.  That&#39;s why I&#39;m bearish on $BTC.X We simply don&#39;t need it."

And since you already have a trading plan, the next things is to have discipline while trading with a professional guides . And with that, combining trading plan with discipline, you&#39;ll start to learn to control your emotion. As long as you&#39;re trading, you&#39;ll always be plagued by fear and greed.

Equities/stockd right now are only going up by &quot;gapping&quot; higher. I&#39;m more confident crypto is deeper into the end part of flushing everything out than equities.

But lots of variables. The Fed reverses and QEs. The war on the Ukraine  ends. Lots of ifs but if things keep going and we keep inflating. The price of every product and  service  has jumped. They say 9.1 % but from what I experience that is total BS. when the negative forces converge and it’s winter I think mkts will tank. We just completed wave 1 down. So wave 2 is a milder retrace. But wave 3 is the big one. We have a shriveling GNP &amp; GDP. We are producing less. More layoffs. Ppl   Cutting back on spending.  So ETH is just part of a relief rally.

Disruption across numerous industries has been occurring, and is likely to accelerate into the future.     Crypto is a tool that is central to this economic technology revolution. At many different levels blockchain and crypto are becoming ubiquitous across the globe:    https://www.tipranks.com/news/article/study-reveals-promising-bitcoin-adoption-figures-across-emerging-markets"

Proper regulation of the digital asset spaces may be one of the most bullish factors in the near term future for crypto.    There is a very large demographic with a tremendous amount of assets waiting to diversify their portfolios with an allocation into crypto. This segment of the population wants to see proper regulation implemented prior to making their investments into crypto.    This regulation is late, but it is coming near. Some other nations are leading the U.S. in regulating the digital asset space. The U.S. government needs to catch up with other nations and also provide global leadership for international regulation.    Regulation is the key to opening the floodgates of capital from the wealthy boomer demographic into crypto. Diversification of portfolios to include an allocation of assets into crypto will take Bitcoin to well above $200K, and the altcoin market will follow.    https://news.bitcoin.com/harvard-professor-rogoff-central-banks-governments-are-way-behind-the-curve-in-regulating-cryptocurrencies/?utm_source=OneSignalPush&amp;utm_medium=notification&amp;utm_campaign=PushNotifications"

The only problem is ppl buy pieces of coins and use pieces of one coin and part of another so  basis is complex. But software takes care of that now. Years ago I had figure fragments of basis juxtaposed against the current transaction w a calculator. But it’s nothing more than another cap gain or cap loss situation. Just  so you know, they teach a lot of things in accounting university classes that you’ll never use. They’re a total waste of time. What they teach in school has almost nothing to do with the real world of accounting. You picked a very dull boring profession. A big mistake.

History shows us what happens to financial markets.   2.  Inflation is flying and will grow worse bc our farmers are struggling.  Diesel and fertilizer at all time highs reducing yields and adds to inflation.  This will continue the next two quarters.   3.  Helicopters of money dropped off to retail investors of which the majority will need to be used for gas, food and electricity and rent in the next few months.  Much less Christmas!  4.  Russia Ukraine situation could lead to massive oil spikes through retaliatory acts on the pipeline.  Look up what happens if part of that pipeline through Ukraine gets stopped for even a day or two.  Massive oil spike overnight.  Oil freezing in the pipeline is a real possibility.    Just a couple of things off the top of my head as to why I’m scratching my head over this spike in crypto.  Dead kitty bounce! Be careful folks!"

And it looks like whales and MM’s are trying really hard to protect their precious ETH. Might as well accept ETH isn’t going to die. Too many stupid sheep will continue to think it’s better than other layer 1’s. Too much money in it. It’s too mainstream. And it does have some merit that over other securities, as it was mineable before the merge. So,  buy some layer 2’s, 3’s, 4’s and such like Michael Saylor said.

Kinda like the ups and downs of .com&#39;s in the 1990s with Mozilla etc... and before the real ponzi that lasted 1998-2000. Then you had &quot;companies&quot; with just a mediocre www address that got millions in funding. Remember localbands.com? Well I saw where those millions went as I attended parties after parties with free drinks etc... I saw no effort made to even have any road to profits. It was just print stocks and get money from that. That&#39;s it.  There is no good quality companies and business models out there to justify the secondary market (i.e securities post IPO) generating so much $$$ and so much bonuses for $GS and the hedgies unless bubbles are created. Massive pump and dumps of such magnitude the SEC can&#39;t handle them because the system is built on those... crypto is now fading and the next bubble is on..."

Look at the market bottoms in 2015 and 2018 on the 3 day chart. Green line is the 3 day MA10, yellow line is the MA50, blue line is MA100 and red line is MA200. Each time, just as the MA100 (blue) crossed the MA200 (red), the bitcoin price action just broke above the MA10 (green). Well...we just went above the 3 day MA10 and the MA100 crossing the MA200 now. To me it looks like we are at the bottom and will go somewhat sideways for the next 2-4 months or so until the MA10 (green) crosses the MA50 (yellow) then its off to the races. This is another of many indicators pointing to us having reached bottom."
