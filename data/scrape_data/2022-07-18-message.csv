Then you had &quot;companies&quot; with just a mediocre www address that got millions in funding. Remember localbands.com? Well I saw where those millions went as I attended parties after parties with free drinks etc... I saw no effort made to even have any road to profits. It was just print stocks and get money from that. That&#39;s it.  There is no good quality companies and business models out there to justify the secondary market (i.e securities post IPO) generating so much $$$ and so much bonuses for $GS and the hedgies unless bubbles are created.

Each time, just as the MA100 (blue) crossed the MA200 (red), the bitcoin price action just broke above the MA10 (green). Well...we just went above the 3 day MA10 and the MA100 crossing the MA200 now. To me it looks like we are at the bottom and will go somewhat sideways for the next 2-4 months or so until the MA10 (green) crosses the MA50 (yellow) then its off to the races.

Not sayin I’d be surprised, nor would it be impossible especially due to the world’s current economy, but those are going to be tough prices to reach based on the current adoption curve. Every drop is a new bargain and a discount for a new buyer and an existing holder.   Altcoins may dump much larger, since $eth.x seems to have become more of a sentiment for altcoin price indication than bitcoin now. And since ETH is moving over to POS, ASIC miners have more incentives to dump at higher liquidity.  However, ASICs are like only 40% of the miners. GPU miners making up for the 60%. ASIC miners most likely dumped what they wanted by now anyway. And since ETH was mined first n now moving to PoS, that gives it the commodity + security debate. Kinda bullish.

Andrew Left, founder of Citron Research says the idea of decentralization, where power is shifted from the hands of centralized entities is the “stupidest thing ever” and pointed out that the only utility Bitcoin has is that it is a collective consciousness of people, with people buying because others are.  https://www.yahoo.com/finance/news/exclusive-short-seller-andrew-left-204643042.html"

Microsoft began publicly trading on the stock exchange around 1985 and I think there are similarities to the creation of $ETH.X Ethereum and $QNT.X Quant around 2015. It took 15 years from the start of the computer and the internet to become a bubble in early 2000 that subsequently collapsed and I think we&#39;ll be in a Crypto bubble between 2030-2032 when the total crypto market cap reaches the area of 30 trillion dollars before collapsing. There will probably be a lull in early to mid 2030&#39;s before the market ramps back up again in late 2030&#39;s. I think we will hit a total crypto market cap of 300 trillion at some point in early 2050&#39;s.

Meanwhile, popular names like Cardano (ADA-USD), Solana (SOL-USD) and Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) have all fallen at least 60% so far in 2022.

This is usually followed by a relief rally then a bigger drop. We are now getting that relief rally looks like.  I am cautiously still watching. I have a nice starter position in btc and eth. If we drop more, I will add more. Once I know for sure we are at bottom, will go in heavier. Remember this, if everyone is expecting 10k, it will not happen and you will keep waiting and miss the bottom. Market always does opposite of the masses. We MAY be at bottom now.

Well it played out as expected. We failed to bounce off the top trendline of the triangle and we are back in it. That is also bearish. The Pi Cycle bottom indicator is also about to cross (green line crossing the red line). This cross so far in the past has marked the bottom of the bear market. Boys and girls, I think we are either AT bottom or about to capitulate in the next 24 to 48 hrs. Bottom may just mean we are going to revisit the prior lows from June 18 or could be lower. I am not trying to time the exact bottom so I am already averaging in myself. Not telling anyone else what to do. This is just my plan. I am backing up the truck and opening the rear gate and gonna sleep in the truck. I hope capitulation occurs during market hours cause my Roth IRA is also ready to load up more. OR all this could just be a load of crap and we go to moon tomorrow."

The former head of one exchange, under condition of anonymity, confirmed that Japanese crypto exchanges had encountered a recent intensification of pressure to relocate any mining or back-office operations out of Russia.

People say they&#39;ll wait for the bottom but is there a single on of them that knows what bottom is? Nope. So we have basically wiped out that massive bull run cycle and are entering back into pre run highs.    The only thing you really have to ask yourself right now is will $BTC.X $ETH.X ever see this current price level in the future again?  If the answer is yes, commit to it, enter, build down, do not sell anything lower then that first entry that you made.  Highly likely bitcoin and ethereum sees today&#39;s price again even if it loses massive value going forward in this bear cycle.  I don&#39;t feel this strategy would apply to these tickers that have no current or future utilization. Meaning, I wouldn&#39;t do this with a pure speculation crypto.

Before the first of the staked ETH can be sold another upgrade is required (Shanghai upgrade). Estimated at 6 months post-merge, but more likely 9-12 months. Only then will a queue begin for anyone that wants to sell (they&#39;ll be earning 12-15% so most probably won&#39;t want to sell). At present the queue would take well over 400 days to get through - and growing daily.     No staked ETH will be sold for Merge + 6 months minimum. and on average it&#39;ll be Merge + 12-20 months.

What the majority wants won’t matter.

Most people have zero understanding of the actual applications outside of utilizing it simply as a quasi-gambling financial asset on which to speculate. This is, in my opinion, the driving factor behind the extremely high volatility and massive swings in the cryptocurrencies connected to blockchain technology. It’s not viewed as a serious asset mostly because it is highly misunderstood — more so than probably any other technology. Blockchain will be similar to Social Media in the future in which almost every individual &amp; industry will utilize the technology in almost every aspect of life. Few cryptocurrencies will actually survive, and only the ones with actual legitimate real-word applications will exist or be taken seriously… much like social media where only a select few are used, however these platforms affect every aspect of our lives."

The whole world is interconnected financially already and was looking for a bridge. Cryptocurrency can eliminate a variety of fees, authorization/transactions, and customer service fees that have burdened small businesses using the credit card system.  Cryptocurrency also facilitates cross-border transactions and save immigrants hundreds of billions bank fees in an attempt to send money to relatives living in developing countries. Those fees, known as remittances were 7.37% of the amount sent. Which is crazy in a globally interconnected world. Bitcoin payment system charges only 0.005 bitcoin or 1% of the transaction, Litecoin is mere pennies and both offer proof or work.

It&#39;s like driving a model-t when there is a Ferrari out there. Yes Bitcoin was the first but it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the best in 2022+.  2) One of the main appeals of Bitcoin and was that you could send it anonymously-- well, the U.S government is putting a stop to that in general.  3) Banks are modernizing rapidly; when Bitcoin was first introduced, yes it was much faster but banks are now developing and already offering instantaneous money transfers (ie Zelle). So the role crypto could have played is being developed by banks through other means.  There is a place for crypto, especially in regards to ownership of digital art, like $ETH.X"

One thing that I’m noticing right now is that unanimously everyone of them is bearish towards Bitcoin and crypto for the short term. “The pain isn’t over” you hear them say, or “the crash is coming, bearish winter is here” Now I’m not going to say that they’re wrong that might be the case, but I can’t help but wonder how come most of them were ultra bullish since last year telling everyone that alt season is coming and to keep buying, hodl, laser eyes and diamond hands when crypto market was at the peak? Now they shifted to bearish and “be careful out there” when the market is 80/90% down🤔  Seems very odd to say the least."

Worse than dumping, he&#39;s trying to lure more victims in a desperate plea to save himself (or that&#39;s how his behavior looks to me).  Seriously -- this is why we all have to use our own heads and make our own decisions in the end. I admit, I&#39;ve been excited about a stock only to change my mind: new information = new decision, so it&#39;s possible he&#39;s an idiot who really believes $BTC is a good investment? 🤔  Why am I bearish? As banks modernize and embrace instantaneous transaction methods (ie  Zelle), the financial role of Crypto is diminished in importance. There are other roles, like ownership of digital art ($ETH.X and NFTs),   but crypto as a means of &#39;instantaneous financial transactions&#39; is losing its importance as banks modernize and as the US clamps down on anonymous crypto transactions.  That&#39;s why I&#39;m bearish on $BTC.X We simply don&#39;t need it."

And since you already have a trading plan, the next things is to have discipline while trading with a professional guides . And with that, combining trading plan with discipline, you&#39;ll start to learn to control your emotion. As long as you&#39;re trading, you&#39;ll always be plagued by fear and greed.

Equities/stockd right now are only going up by &quot;gapping&quot; higher. I&#39;m more confident crypto is deeper into the end part of flushing everything out than equities.
