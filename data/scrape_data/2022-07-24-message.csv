They say 9.1 % but from what I experience that is total BS. when the negative forces converge and it‚Äôs winter I think mkts will tank. We just completed wave 1 down. So wave 2 is a milder retrace. But wave 3 is the big one. We have a shriveling GNP &amp; GDP. We are producing less. More layoffs. Ppl   Cutting back on spending.  So ETH is just part of a relief rally.

My son bought like $800 of $ETH.X when he was 14, lol (when it hit $1,200 that first time) it was his money he saved, so we let him. Then came that fucked up bear market. ETH hit like $185? He knew it was bad, but he told me, &quot;I&#39;m not even looking at it.&quot; He was pissed but he didn&#39;t touch it. 2 years passed and ETH hit $4,500 from there as we all know.

Proper regulation of the digital asset spaces may be one of the most bullish factors in the near term future for crypto.    There is a very large demographic with a tremendous amount of assets waiting to diversify their portfolios with an allocation into crypto. This segment of the population wants to see proper regulation implemented prior to making their investments into crypto.    This regulation is late, but it is coming near. Some other nations are leading the U.S. in regulating the digital asset space. The U.S. government needs to catch up with other nations and also provide global leadership for international regulation.    Regulation is the key to opening the floodgates of capital from the wealthy boomer demographic into crypto. Diversification of portfolios to include an allocation of assets into crypto will take Bitcoin to well above $200K, and the altcoin market will follow.    https://news.bitcoin.com/harvard-professor-rogoff-central-banks-governments-are-way-behind-the-curve-in-regulating-cryptocurrencies/?utm_source=OneSignalPush&amp;utm_medium=notification&amp;utm_campaign=PushNotifications"

There‚Äôs nothing to learn. it‚Äôs an asset. then it‚Äôs FMV at point of transaction(selling or buying) and tracking its basis w/ FIFO just like with a stock. The only problem is ppl buy pieces of coins and use pieces of one coin and part of another so  basis is complex. But software takes care of that now. Years ago I had figure fragments of basis juxtaposed against the current transaction w a calculator. But it‚Äôs nothing more than another cap gain or cap loss situation. Just  so you know, they teach a lot of things in accounting university classes that you‚Äôll never use. They‚Äôre a total waste of time. What they teach in school has almost nothing to do with the real world of accounting. You picked a very dull boring profession. A big mistake. Change majors now or you will regret it for the rest of your life. I regret being a CPA. Most accountants are stiffs. Luckily I retire this year. Get out now. Good advice!"

Helicopters of money dropped off to retail investors of which the majority will need to be used for gas, food and electricity and rent in the next few months.  Much less Christmas!  4.  Russia Ukraine situation could lead to massive oil spikes through retaliatory acts on the pipeline.  Look up what happens if part of that pipeline through Ukraine gets stopped for even a day or two.  Massive oil spike overnight.  Oil freezing in the pipeline is a real possibility.    Just a couple of things off the top of my head as to why I‚Äôm scratching my head over this spike in crypto.

Then you had &quot;companies&quot; with just a mediocre www address that got millions in funding. Remember localbands.com? Well I saw where those millions went as I attended parties after parties with free drinks etc... I saw no effort made to even have any road to profits. It was just print stocks and get money from that. That&#39;s it.  There is no good quality companies and business models out there to justify the secondary market (i.e securities post IPO) generating so much $$$ and so much bonuses for $GS and the hedgies unless bubbles are created.

Each time, just as the MA100 (blue) crossed the MA200 (red), the bitcoin price action just broke above the MA10 (green). Well...we just went above the 3 day MA10 and the MA100 crossing the MA200 now. To me it looks like we are at the bottom and will go somewhat sideways for the next 2-4 months or so until the MA10 (green) crosses the MA50 (yellow) then its off to the races.
